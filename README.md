# devstages

This repository contains accompanying documentation for a submission to LREC-COLING 2024.

* The pdf file contains the linguistic specification for Processability Theory's hypothesized developmental stages for verb placement in German.
* The tsv file contains a collection of varied test sentences/clauses. Each line breaks down the clause's structure in terms of topological field theory and gives the label for the verb placement constellation found in the clause.
